## 🚀 The Proposal
Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.
(e.g., "I want to track my Letterboxd stats but there is no module for it.")

## 🛠️ Potential API
If you know of an official API for this platform, please link it here. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Strict Official API Policy:** SocialFetch does **not** support web scraping. We only accept modules that utilize official REST or GraphQL endpoints to ensure project stability and user security.

## 🎨 Aesthetic Mockup

```text
🎬 Letterboxd  1,240 watched  45 reviews
```
